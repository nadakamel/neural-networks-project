# Arabic Tweets Sentiment Analysis: Deep Learning Approach
Sentiment analysis of Social Media has become a hot  area  of  research  recently.  As the rise of social media pervasiveness in all aspects of life, the need of extracted information from it rises as well. Twitter in specific due to its short post nature is easy to use and condense the information in short sentence. Arabic Sentiment analysis from social  media is considered a challenging due to the different styles, dialects and preprocessing of the language itself. 
In our work we tackle the Arabic twitter sentiment analysis using a deep learning approach. We investigated different approaches using Convolutional networks  and  LSTM  on  ASTD  data  set and we could reach accuracy of 0.68 and F1-score of 0.68.
